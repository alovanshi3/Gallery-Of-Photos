This repository contains a project demonstrating various image hover effects using HTML and CSS. The project includes images that are initially displayed with a grey filter. When hovered over, the images revert to their original colors, scale up, and display a shadow effect along with text appearing over the image.

Technologies Used
HTML: The structure of the webpage is created using HTML, providing a semantic layout for the images and their corresponding hover effects.
CSS: The styling and hover effects are implemented using CSS, utilizing properties like filters, transforms, transitions, and box-shadows to achieve the desired visual effects.
